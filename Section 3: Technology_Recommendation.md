### **Section 3: Technology Recommendation and Justification**

**Recommended Technology Approach**
Based on the analysis of **REST, GraphQL**, and **WebSockets** from Sections 1 and 2, we have come to conclusion that a **hybrid approach combining WebSockets with REST API** is best for  **IoT healthcare monitoring system**.
 
- **WebSockets** should be used for real-time **continuous streaming of critical sensor data** (e.g., **oxygen levels and heart rate**) to enable **instant updates** without polling overhead.
- **REST API** should be used for **non-real-time data retrieval, historical sensor records, configuration management, and user interactions** that don’t require live updates.
 
---
 
 **Justification for the Hybrid Approach**
**1. Real-time Data Streaming with WebSockets**
- The **primary requirement of IoT healthcare monitoring** is to ensure **continuous and instant updates** from sensors **without delays**.
- **REST and GraphQL require polling**, which increases **network load and latency**, whereas **WebSockets maintain a persistent, low-latency connection**.
- **Example:** If a patient’s **oxygen level drops suddenly**, a **WebSocket-based push notification** can alert doctors instantly instead of waiting for the next REST request.
 
**2. Efficient Data Management with REST API**
- **REST API remains useful for non-real-time operations**, such as:
  - Retrieving **historical sensor data** for analysis.
  - **User authentication and device configurations**.
  - **Storing and updating patient records** in a structured database.
- **Example:** A doctor can request **past 24-hour oxygen level trends** using REST instead of receiving continuous WebSocket updates.
 
#### **3. Scalability and Performance Considerations**
- **WebSockets are ideal for high-frequency real-time data updates**, but they are **resource-intensive**.
- **REST API complements WebSockets** by handling **bulk data retrieval**, reducing server load and ensuring scalability.
- The hybrid approach allows **scalable deployment**—**WebSockets for active patient monitoring** and **REST for data access**.

### **Reason why Hybrid Approach Best for Performance, Scalability, and Real-time in IOT healthcare monitoring is best suited **
| **Factor** | **Why Hybrid Approach Works** |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Performance** | WebSockets ensure **low-latency real-time updates**, while REST handles **efficient batch data retrieval**. |
| **Scalability** | REST API can be **horizontally scaled** for handling **large data storage and queries**, while WebSockets can be optimized for **selective real-time monitoring**. |
| **Real-time Capabilities** | WebSockets **eliminate the need for polling**, enabling **instant push-based updates** for sensor alerts. |
| **Efficiency** | REST API reduces unnecessary **real-time network usage**, improving overall **resource efficiency**. |

### **Final Conclusion**
The **WebSockets + REST hybrid approach** ensures **instantaneous real-time alerts** for **critical sensor readings** while maintaining a **scalable and structured API for broader system management**. This balances **performance, efficiency, and real-time requirements**, making it the optimal choice for the **IoT healthcare monitoring system**.
