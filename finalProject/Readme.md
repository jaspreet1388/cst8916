# **Final Project Assignment: Real-time Monitoring System for Rideau Canal Skateway**
### **Scenario: Rideau Canal Skateway Monitoring**


## Scenario Description

The Rideau Canal Skateway is one of Ottawa’s most iconic winter attractions, drawing thousands of visitors each season. Ensuring the safety of skaters requires real-time monitoring of environmental conditions such as ice thickness, surface temperature, snow accumulation, and weather data.

This project implements a real-time monitoring system that simulates IoT sensors at key locations along the canal. The system continuously analyzes this data to detect unsafe skating conditions and stores the results for future analysis.
To address this, we can design a real-time monitoring system that simulates IoT sensors which is deployed at key locations along the Rideau Canal (Dow’s Lake, Fifth Avenue, NAC). These sensors collect data about the following parameters every 10 seconds:

Ice Thickness (in cm): Critical for determining whether the ice is thick enough to support skaters.
Surface Temperature (in °C): Helps identify the potential for ice melting, which could be dangerous for skaters.
Snow Accumulation (in cm): Impacts the strength and usability of the ice surface.
External Temperature (in °C): Provides weather context and indicates whether external weather conditions might be a risk.
