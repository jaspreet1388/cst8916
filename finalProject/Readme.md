### **Final Project Assignment: Real-time Monitoring System for Rideau Canal Skateway**
## **Scenario: Rideau Canal Skateway Monitoring**
The Rideau Canal Skateway, a historic and world-renowned attraction in Ottawa, needs constant monitoring to ensure skater safety. You have been hired by the National Capital Commission (NCC) to build a real-time data streaming system that will:

Simulate IoT sensors to monitor ice conditions and weather factors along the canal.
Process incoming sensor data to detect unsafe conditions in real time.
Store the results in Azure Blob Storage for further analysis.
Overview
In this assignment, you will design and implement a real-time monitoring system for the Rideau Canal Skateway using simulated IoT sensors, Azure IoT Hub, Azure Stream Analytics, and Azure Blob Storage. The system will simulate sensor data, process it in real time, and store the output in Azure Blob Storage.
