WebSockets would significantly enhance the IoT healthcare monitoring system by enabling bi-directional, low-latency communication between IoT Edge devices, cloud services, and client applications. Unlike REST and GraphQL, which require repeated polling to retrieve new data, WebSockets allow a persistent connection, ensuring real-time updates for critical sensor readings like oxygen levels and heart rate.
Implementation of WebSockets in IoT Healthcare Monitoring
Establishing a WebSocket Connection:
A WebSocket server runs on the IoT Edge device or a cloud service.
Clients (web apps, mobile apps) establish a WebSocket connection to receive live sensor data.
Continuous Streaming of Sensor Data:
The IoT Edge device continuously streams oxygen level and heart rate data to connected clients.
Clients receive instant updates instead of making repeated GET requests.
Event-driven Data Transmission:
Instead of polling REST endpoints, WebSockets push new data only when the sensor detects changes.
The WebSocket server can broadcast alerts when oxygen levels drop below a critical threshold.
Two-way Communication for Control & Alerts:
Doctors or system admins can send commands (e.g., reset device, request additional data) via WebSockets.
The IoT Edge device can respond immediately, enhancing responsiveness.
