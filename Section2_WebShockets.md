**Section 2: WebSockets for Real-time Comunication**

Web Sockets is important because it is used to constantly receive data from the other device and able to reply quickly. There are specific use cases that certain data are collected in certain frequencies. For the devices to be synchronise, they first need to establish a connection by doing a two-way handshake. Then they develop a single connection between devices to avoid reestablishing another connection. For example, devices that are constantly collecting health data every second such as continuous glucose monitors and fitness trackers. Also, these devices can adjust the frequency of how long the duration that the data will be collected.

Compared to REST and GraphQL, web sockets do not need for the client to send a request to receive data. Instead, the server gives intermediate update to the client.
