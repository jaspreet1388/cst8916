Assignment Title: Real-Time IoT Monitoring System for Heart Rate and Oxygen Sensors

Objective:To understand the design, components, and working of a real-time IoT-based monitoring system for heart rate and oxygen sensors, along with its applications in healthcare.

1. Introduction

With advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), real-time health monitoring systems have become an essential part of modern healthcare. This assignment focuses on an IoT-based system that continuously tracks heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, enabling remote patient monitoring and real-time alerts.

2. System Components

a. Wearable Sensors

Heart Rate Sensor (PPG, ECG): Measures beats per minute (BPM).

Oxygen Sensor (SpO2, Pulse Oximeter): Measures blood oxygen saturation levels.

These sensors are embedded in smartwatches, fitness bands, or medical-grade devices.

b. Microcontroller/Edge Device

Examples: ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or any IoT-enabled medical device.

Collects raw sensor data and processes it before transmission.

c. Communication Module

Wireless Protocols: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Zigbee, or NB-IoT.

Ensures secure and efficient data transfer.

d. Cloud/Edge Computing

Cloud Platforms: Azure IoT Hub, AWS IoT Core, Google Cloud IoT.

Processes real-time data, applies analytics, and detects anomalies.

Edge computing may be utilized for fast, low-latency processing.

e. Database & Storage

Time-Series Databases: InfluxDB, Firebase, or Azure Cosmos DB.

Stores historical data for analysis and predictive modeling.

f. Real-Time Dashboard & Alerts

Visualization Tools: Power BI, Grafana, or a custom web dashboard.

Alerts: Sends SMS, emails, or notifications if vitals cross predefined thresholds.

AI/ML Integration: Detects abnormal patterns indicating potential health issues.
